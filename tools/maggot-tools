  <p>Sharing descriptive Metadata is the first essential step towards Open Scientific Data. With this in mind, Maggot was specifically designed to annotate datasets by creating a metadata file to attach to the storage space. Indeed, it allows users to easily add descriptive metadata to datasets produced within a collective of people (research unit, platform, multi-partner project, etc.). This approach fits perfectly into a data management plan as it addresses the issues of data organization and documentation, data storage and frictionless metadata sharing within this same collective and beyond.</p>
